# About Lucy

> Inspired by the meaning of my name (Lucy) – Light, I am passionate about figuring out hidden insights and bringing them to light.

# Who I Am

> I have almost 4 years working in the intersection of data analytics, sales operations-strategy, and quantitative consumer research.
I like solving analytical problems related to market segmentation, forecasting, pricing, enhancing user experience, supply chain design, by using statistical/ machine learning techniques such as clustering, random forest, neural network, hypothesis testing, NLP, integer programming, and data analytics & visualization tools e.g. Python, R, SQL, SAS, SPSS, Excel Analysis ToolPak, Excel Solver, Tableau.

# analytics-projects

* [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/lucy-doan/analytics-projects/tree/master/Loan%20Default%20Prediction)
This project analyzes existing loan applicant data to predict risk type (high/low risk) of incoming applicants. This is a real-world dataset of a US bank, containing profiles of 100,000, about their demographics, financial health, such as debt ratio, and credit-using behaviors, e.g. The ratio of total balance on lines of credit to total credit limits.

I wrote Python codes to build 2 Machine Learning models, using Random Forest Classifier and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) Classifier. Also, an oversampling method, SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, is applied to deal with imbalanced dataset.

* [Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/lucy-doan/analytics-projects/tree/master/Stock%20Price%20Prediction)
The first quarter of 2020 observes multiple stock market crash that reflects the downturn of the US economy due to Coronavirus; however, AMZN (Amazon) and KG (Kroger) are among a few stocks “survived” in early phase of the pandemic. Having said that, we don't know what future holds if the outbreak lasts long. Therefore, forecasting price of the two stocks is an effort to disclose the uncertainty and understand the factors that affect each stock’s performance. Data is collected from Yahoo Finance, on a daily basis (daily price) from 03-01-2000 to 08-05-2020. Besides the 2 above stocks, the predicting models also take into account stock prices of 30 companies within Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) to reflect competition landscape and macro economy.

After adopting two predicting algorithms, linear regression and regression forest, performance metrics are calculated to evaluate and select the optimal predicting model for each stock.

* [Real Estate Market Analysis with SQL and Tableau](https://github.com/lucy-doan/analytics-projects/tree/master/Real%20Estate%20Market%20Analysis%20with%20SQL%20and%20Tableau)
Analyzing customer data of a real estate company in Sacramento CA, the project focuses on understanding its product pricing, customer risks, and sales territory. They will be important imput to make the decisions regarding customer segmentation, targeting and positioning. In addition to the real estate data, the project also refers to the US demographic data in the same period for the purpose of assessing financial risk of the customers.

SQL is used for data cleasing, wrangling, and analysis, while Tableau is for visualization dashboard.


* [Digital Ads Campaign Evaluation](https://github.com/lucy-doan/analytics-projects/tree/master/Digital%20Ads%20Campaign%20Evaluation)
The project aims at measuring the impacts of online advertising on conversion rate and optimizing marketing spends. The data is drawn from an experimental study, in which users were assigned to test group and control group, where they would see the testing ads only or a charity's ads only.

Associated with the report document is an Excel spreadsheet containing raw data and calculation details, and a Python jupyter notebook with codes of a binary classification model and data visualization.
